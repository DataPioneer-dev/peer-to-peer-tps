# Real-Time P2P Communication

This repository contains the resources and source code for the practical work on developing a real-time Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication application using different technologies.

## Description

This practical work contains three parts as each part explicits the following subjects :

- **TP1** : focuses on manipulating the HTTP protocol using the JEE platform, especially its servlet component. It includes presenting the theoretical foundation of the JEE platform and practical development of an HTML and HttpServlet-based application using Tomcat and Eclipse EE IDE. Extensions are required to cover remaining servlet and presentation layer aspects.
- **TP2** : aims to apply course concepts through real-time web application development using HTML, HTTP, and NODEJS. Extensions will also address real-time web development aspects, particularly focusing on the "MEAN STACK" platform.
- **TP3** : involves developing a P2P application based on WEBRTC and HTML5 technologies following course principles. This application facilitates media and data exchange between users through their browsers, requiring a signaling channel for session negotiation, peer discovery, and NAT/firewall traversal using technologies like XHR, Websocket, NodeJS, ICE, STUN, and TURN.
